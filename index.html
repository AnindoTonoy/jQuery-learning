      Astatine is a very rare radioactive chemical element with the chemical
      symbol At and the atomic number 85. It occurs on Earth as the decay
      product of heavier elements. All its isotopes are short-lived, with
      half-lives of 8.1 hours or less. The element has never been viewed because
      a mass large enough to be seen would be immediately vaporized by the heat
      of its radioactivity. The bulk properties of astatine are not known with
      any certainty, but they have been predicted based on its similarity to the
      lighter halogens directly above it in the periodic table: fluorine,
      chlorine, bromine and especially iodine. It is likely to appear dark or
      lustrous and may be a semiconductor or a metal. Chemically, several
      anionic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble
      those of iodine. It also shows some metallic behavior, and may be able to
      form a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution, unlike the lighter
      halogens.
